/**
 * Configures rate-limiting key resolver beans for the Spring Cloud Gateway.
 *
 * <p>Two resolvers are provided:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code remoteAddrKeyResolver} — for pre-authentication routes (e.g. /auth/**).
 *       Extracts the leftmost IP from {@code X-Forwarded-For} when the gateway sits
 *       behind a reverse proxy or load-balancer, falling back to the TCP remote address.
 *       Without this fix, all clients share a single rate-limit bucket equal to the
 *       proxy's IP, making per-IP isolation completely ineffective.</li>
 *   <li>{@code userKeyResolver} — for authenticated routes. Uses the {@code X-Auth-User}
 *       header injected by {@link com.hotelpms.gateway.filter.AuthenticationFilter} after
 *       JWT validation. Per-user buckets prevent a single compromised or malicious account
 *       from flooding the API and causing a denial-of-service for other tenants. Falls back
 *       to the proxy-aware IP when the header is absent.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Both beans are referenced by name in the {@code api-gateway.yml} rate-limiter
 * filter definitions:
 * <pre>
 *   key-resolver: "#{@remoteAddrKeyResolver}"   # pre-auth routes
 *   key-resolver: "#{@userKeyResolver}"          # authenticated routes
 * </pre>
